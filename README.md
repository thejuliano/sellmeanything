# sellmeanything

Sell me anything! 

Goal of the project is to create a small website that buys anything, and everything, from individuals. The idea is that everyone has some junk or used stuff they want to get rid of - I'll evaluate the offers from said individuals, get them, refurbish them, and re-sell them via multiple sales channels.
